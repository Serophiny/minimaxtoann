### Train ANN with Minimax algorithm for Tic-Tac-Toe

Tested with: Python 2.7 & 3.7

---

Runs the [Minimax algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) and trains an ANN with the output.

Uses Dense Layers, Convolutional-Layers would probably (99.9995%) be better.


You need only to adjust the LEN_ITER & run. Played boards may be printed and model be saved.

After some iterations (>100k-1000k i guess) it hopefully converges to an quite good solution.. 
Or not, i didn't try it that far, just for ~50k, and it did quite good moves, but still some(probably many) bad moves..

The ANN-Topology maybe needs an adjustment as well, it's always trial and error isn't it :)
